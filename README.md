pyusb wrappers for using a ch341 in i2c mode.

Somewhat based on git@github.com:commandtab/ch341eeprom.git but more openended,
and not feeling the need to do everything in C.

usb2i2c: https://code.google.com/p/usb2i2c/ seems to be identical protocols,
possibly earlier versions of the same chips. (And there's code available!
whee!)
